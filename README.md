# OpenCV with Python in 4 Hours
Notes and code used in my [**Python and OpenCV course**](https://youtu.be/gLDJEY49M38)

# Course Outline (with timestamps)
### 1. Installing the necessary packages
Besides installing OpenCV, we cover the installation of the following packages:

`caer` is a powerful utilities package with tons of useful helper functions for most Computer Vision tasks
<pre>$ pip install caer</pre>

`canaro` is a Python package solely for Deep Learning models built in Keras
<pre>$ pip install canaro</pre>


### 2. Basic Concepts:
