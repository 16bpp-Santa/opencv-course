# OpenCV with Python in 5 Hours
Notes and code used in my Python and OpenCV course

# Course Outline (with timestamps)
### 1. Installing the necessary packages
Besides installing OpenCV, we cover the installation of the following packages:

`caer` is a powerful utilities package with tons of useful helper functions for most Computer Vision taks
<pre-$ pip install caer</pre>

`canaro` is a Python package solely for Deep Learning models built in Keras
<pre-$ pip install canaro</pre>


### 2. Basic Concepts:
- Reading Images and Video
- Resizing and Rescaling Images and Video Frames
- Drawing Shapes and Placing text on images
- 5 Commonly Used Methods in OpenCV
- Basic Image Transformations
- Basic Contour Detection
    
### 3. Advanced Concepts:
- Switching between Colour Spaces (RGB, BGR, Grayscale, HSV and L*a*b)
- Splitting and Merging Colour Channels
- Blurring Techniques
- BITWISE operations
- Masking 
- Histogram Computation
- Thresholding/Binarizing Images
- Advanced Edge Detection 
    
### 4. Face Detection and Recognition
- Face Detection using Haar Cascades
- Face Recognition using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer algorithm
    
### 5. Capstone: Deep Computer Vision
- Building a Deep Computer Vision model to classify between the characters in the popular TV series The Simpsons
